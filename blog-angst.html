            <h1>The Absolute Worst...</h1>
            <div class="post-meta">July 10, 2025</div>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>
                    You hit me with that "worst day ever" routine,  
                    Head shaking, voice whining, like a broken machine.  
                    Hold up, friend, let me tell you what's truly obscene,  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The worst ain't a burnt pizza or a missed train,  
                    It's pouring your heart, your sweat, your blood like rain,  
                    Into something you believe in, with a fire in your vein,  
                    Then getting tossed aside, forgotten, like a hurricane's disdain.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everywhere you turn, achievements collect dust,  
                    Memories fade faster than a moth in a gust.  
                    The worst ain't a fight with your bestie, a trust turned to rust,  
                    It's being the shoulder to cry on, the one they always trust,  
                </p>
                <p>
                    But when your tears fall, there's no hand to hold,  
                    Just echoes in the darkness, a story untold.  
                    The worst ain't loneliness, a heart growing cold,  
                    It's the slow, creeping acceptance of that story getting old.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    You think rock bottom's losing hope, the future a blur?  
                    Nah, the worst's the flicker of light, a love that seems pure,  
                    The warmth on your skin, a feeling that's sure,  
                    Only to have it vanish, leaving you wanting more.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The worst ain't the absence of love, that sting you can't ignore,  
                    It's the cruel illusion, a love you can't explore,  
                    A mirage in the desert, leaving you wanting more,  
                    That, my friend, is the absolute worst to the core.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    You walk in, all "Ugh, worst day ever!" like a broken record on repeat.  
                    I hear you, but know well, that the worst is not just your lost keys.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worst is not a one-time thing, no. Worst is the slow burn. You pour your heart,  
                    your whole damn soul, into something, and then what? Poof! Every time, gone.  
                    Forgotten faster than yesterday's news. Ignored like who you knew you.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everywhere you go, your achievements? Dust bunnies. Memories? Moth food.  
                    Worst ain't a fight with your BFF, trust me. Worst is being the friend everyone calls for help,  
                    the shoulder to cry on, but when you need them? Crickets.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loneliness? Yeah, that stings. But worst? Way worse. Worst is when you finally  
                    think you might find some light, some love, you know? And then – bam! Just a flimsy mirage.  
                    Disappears like smoke.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The real worst ain't the absence of love, it's the realization of a fake-out. The false sense of "almost had it"  
                    that leaves you emptier than before. That, my friend, is the absolute worst.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    But carry on, it's not like I am bittered by the stab of this pain. Who will care? It's just an irritant,  
                    with time it shall fade—or so I hope!  
                    I am sorry, where were we? Oh yeah, losing keys is the worst, I know.  
                </p>
                <p>
    - Just another man trying to cope
